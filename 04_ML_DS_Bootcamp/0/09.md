Data engineering is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining the systems that collect, store, transform, and
provide access to data at scale. Big data refers to very large or complex data sets that exceed traditional processing
capabilities, often characterized by the 5 Vs: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value.

Key concepts:

- Data pipelines: End-to-end flows that ingest data from sources, process it (cleanse, transform, enrich), and deliver it to
  storage and analytics tools.
- Data storage and architectures: Data lakes for raw/varied data, data warehouses for structured, query-ready data, and data
  lakehouses that combine both.
- Processing frameworks: Batch processing (e.g., ETL jobs) and real-time/streaming processing (e.g., Kafka, Spark Streaming).
- Data quality and governance: Validation, lineage, cataloging, security, and compliant access control.
- Roles and tools: Data engineers build pipelines and manage infrastructure; common tools include SQL engines, distributed
  file systems, cloud data services, and orchestration platforms.

How they relate:

- Data engineering covers building the pipelines and systems needed to work with big data; big data describes the scale and
  characteristics of the data these systems handle. In practice, modern data engineering is typically implemented to manage
  big data challenges.

Illustrative example:

- A retailer collects transaction logs, website clicks, and inventory signals in real time. A data engineering team ingests
  these sources, cleans and normalizes the data, stores it in a data lake, and builds a real-time dashboard in which analysts
  can spot stockouts or demand spikes. This workflow exemplifies data engineering for big data: scalable ingestion,
  processing, storage, and accessible analytics.

If you’d like, I can tailor this explanation to a specific industry or job role (e.g., for a data engineer role, for business
analytics teams, or for students starting out). I can also provide a quick glossary of common terms or a simple diagram
description of a typical data pipeline.
