**X and y follow a standard machine learning convention.**

In scikit-learn's `train_test_split`, **X** (uppercase) represents the feature matrix or input data, which is typically a 2D
array of multiple predictor variables. **y** (lowercase) denotes the target vector or output labels, usually a 1D array of
the variable being predicted.

This casing distinction originated in linear algebra and statistics, where matrices are uppercase (like X for inputs) and
vectors are lowercase (like y for responses). It's a widely adopted practice across libraries and tutorials for clarity.
