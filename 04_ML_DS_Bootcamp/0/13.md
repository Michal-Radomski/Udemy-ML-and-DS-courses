Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to automatically learn
representations from data, especially for complex perceptual tasks like images, audio, and natural language. The main
differences are:

- What they focus on
  - Machine learning is a broad field of algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions.
  - Deep learning specifically uses deep artificial neural networks with many layers to model intricate patterns.
- Data needs
  - Traditional ML often works well with moderate amounts of labeled data.
  - Deep learning typically requires large datasets to perform well.
- Feature engineering
  - In ML, humans usually craft features (feature extraction) to feed the model.
  - In DL, the model learns hierarchical features automatically from raw data.
- Computation
  - ML methods can run well on standard CPUs and smaller datasets.
  - DL models usually require GPUs/TPUs and substantial computational resources.
- Interpretability
  - Many ML models (like linear models, decision trees) are relatively easier to interpret.
  - Deep neural networks are often considered black boxes and harder to interpret.
- Typical use cases
  - ML: spam filtering, basic recommendation systems, classic regression/classification tasks.
  - DL: image and video recognition, speech and language processing, complex game playing.

Illustration

- Think of ML as a craftsman who hand-crafts features to teach a model, whereas DL is like an autonomous student who learns
  to recognize objects directly from raw images without explicit feature design.

If you’d like, I can tailor this to a specific domain (e.g., computer vision, NLP) or provide a quick comparison table with
concrete examples.
