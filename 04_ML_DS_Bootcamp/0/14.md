**TensorFlow** is the core open-source machine learning framework for building, training, and deploying models from scratch using Python APIs like Keras or low-level operations. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow_Hub)

**TensorFlow Hub** is a specialized library and repository that extends TensorFlow by providing pre-trained model components (called modules) for tasks like image classification, text embeddings, and transfer learning. [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_issues)

## Key Differences

| Aspect              | TensorFlow                                      | TensorFlow Hub                                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Full framework for model creation and training  [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/overview) | Repository/library for reusing pre-trained modules  [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow_Hub) |
| **Installation**    | `pip install tensorflow`  [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub)                | `pip install tensorflow-hub` (requires TensorFlow)  [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_issues) |
| **Usage Example**   | Build models with `tf.keras.Sequential()`  [apxml](https://apxml.com/courses/getting-started-with-tensorflow/chapter-6-saving-loading-models/introduction-tensorflow-hub) | Load via `hub.KerasLayer("https://tfhub.dev/...")`  [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55585079/can-a-tensorflow-hub-module-be-used-in-tensorflow-2-0) |
| **Scope**           | End-to-end ML workflows  [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/overview)                 | Transfer learning and feature extraction  [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow_Hub) |

TensorFlow Hub integrates seamlessly with TensorFlow (e.g., via `hub.load()` or `hub.KerasLayer`), enabling quick reuse of models like BERT without retraining everything. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55585079/can-a-tensorflow-hub-module-be-used-in-tensorflow-2-0)
