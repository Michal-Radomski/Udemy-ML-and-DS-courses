An AI model is a broad trained system for tasks like prediction or generation, while an artificial neural network (ANN) is a
specific architecture mimicking brain neurons, often powering deep learning subsets of AI models.

## Core Differences

AI models encompass various techniques beyond just neural networks, including rule-based systems or simpler statistical
methods, whereas ANNs specifically use interconnected nodes (neurons) in layers to process data hierarchically.
[blog.invgate](https://blog.invgate.com/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-neural-networks) Neural networks form the
backbone of deep learning models but require large datasets and compute power, unlike broader AI models that can use less
data or predefined rules. [seldon](https://www.seldon.io/neural-network-models-explained/) For example, a basic AI model
might classify emails with decision trees, but an ANN excels at image recognition by learning complex patterns across
multiple layers.

## Framework Purposes

TensorFlow builds, trains, and deploys deep learning models like neural networks for scalable AI applications, such as image
classification or NLP. [digitalregenesys](https://www.digitalregenesys.com/blog/introduction-to-ai-libraries) PyTorch
supports dynamic neural network research and custom architectures, popular in academia for tasks like GANs and transformers.
[mljourney](https://mljourney.com/scikit-learn-vs-tensorflow-vs-pytorch-which-one-to-use/) Scikit-learn handles traditional
machine learning (regression, clustering) on structured data, ideal for simpler models without deep neural nets.
