Keras is a high-level, user-friendly API for building and training neural networks, now officially integrated as tf.keras
within TensorFlow. TensorFlow is Google's open-source framework for machine learning, handling low-level tensor operations,
GPU/TPU acceleration, and scalable model deployment.

## Key Features

Keras simplifies rapid prototyping with modular layers and pre-built components, making it ideal for beginners and quick
experiments. TensorFlow provides deeper control, including tools like TensorBoard for visualization and support for
distributed training on large datasets. [101blockchains](https://101blockchains.com/keras-vs-tensorflow/)

## Relationship

Originally independent, Keras now runs natively on TensorFlow as its recommended high-level interface since TensorFlow 2.0,
combining ease-of-use with TensorFlow's power. You typically use `tf.keras` for most deep learning tasks today.
