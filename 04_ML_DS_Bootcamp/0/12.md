Apache Spark is an open-source, unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, designed for speed, ease of use, and versatility across batch, streaming, machine learning, and graph workloads. It significantly outperforms older frameworks like Hadoop MapReduce by processing data primarily in memory rather than on disk.

## Core Architecture
Spark's foundation is Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), immutable collections of data partitioned across cluster nodes, enabling fault-tolerant parallel processing via a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) execution model. This allows optimizations like lazy evaluation and reuse of intermediate data, making iterative tasks (e.g., machine learning training) up to 100x faster in memory.

Key components include Spark Core for task distribution, Spark SQL for structured data queries, Spark Streaming (now Structured Streaming) for real-time data, MLlib for machine learning, and GraphX for graph analytics. [chaossearch](https://www.chaossearch.io/blog/apache-spark-analytics)

## Use in Big Data Engineering
Spark integrates seamlessly with tools like Kafka for streaming ingestion, Hadoop HDFS for storage, and NewSQL databases for scalable querying, forming efficient ETL/ELT pipelines—for instance, analyzing petabytes of logs to detect anomalies in real time.
