NumPy performs element-wise array division using the `/` operator or `np.divide()`, which divides corresponding elements
between arrays. Multiplication uses `*` or `np.multiply()` for the same element-wise operation.

## Element-Wise Division

Use the `/` operator for simple division between compatible arrays, as it applies true division (floating-point results)
pairwise. [sparkbyexamples](https://sparkbyexamples.com/python/python-numpy-divide-function/)

The `np.divide()` function explicitly handles this too, supporting broadcasting for different shapes.

**Example:**

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.array([10, 20, 30])
b = np.array([2, 4, 5])
result = a / b  # or np.divide(a, b)
print(result)  # [5. 5. 6.]
```

Arrays must match shapes or be broadcastable; division by zero yields `inf` or `nan`.

## Element-Wise Multiplication

Apply `*` for direct element-wise products, or use `np.multiply()` for clarity.

**Example:**

```python
c = np.array([1, 2, 3])
d = np.array([4, 5, 6])
product = c * d  # or np.multiply(c, d)
print(product)  # [4 10 18]
```

This works with scalars too, scaling all elements uniformly.
