# What is softmax and sigmoid. What are differences?

Sigmoid and softmax are activation functions commonly used in neural networks, especially for classification tasks. Sigmoid
maps inputs to a probability between 0 and 1, while softmax converts a vector of inputs into a probability distribution that
sums to 1 across multiple classes.[^9]

## Sigmoid Function

The sigmoid function, defined as $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$, squashes any real-valued input to the range (0, 1).[^9]
It suits binary classification, like spam detection, where the output represents the probability of one class (the other is 1
minus that value).[^3][^5] Outputs from multiple sigmoids are independent and do not sum to 1, making it useful for
multi-label scenarios where classes can overlap.[^1]

## Softmax Function

Softmax applies exponentials to a vector of inputs $z = [z_1, z_2, \dots, z_K]$, then normalizes:
$\sigma(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{z_j}}$.[^9] It is ideal for multi-class classification with mutually exclusive
classes, like image recognition, ensuring probabilities sum to 1 and the highest logit dominates.[^5][^3] This normalization
promotes competition between classes, unlike sigmoid's independence.[^1]

## Key Differences

| Aspect            | Sigmoid                                         | Softmax                                       |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Input Type        | Single value or independent per output [^9]     | Vector of values (logits) [^9]                |
| Output Sum        | Independent; does not sum to 1 [^10]            | Always sums to 1 across classes [^10]         |
| Primary Use       | Binary or multi-label classification [^3]       | Multi-class (exclusive) classification [^3]   |
| Computation Cost  | One exponential per neuron [^3]                 | Exponentials for all classes + normalize [^3] |
| Gradient Behavior | Prone to vanishing gradients in saturation [^1] | Better with cross-entropy loss [^1]           |

Softmax is computationally heavier but often leads to more stable multi-class training.[^1][^9]
