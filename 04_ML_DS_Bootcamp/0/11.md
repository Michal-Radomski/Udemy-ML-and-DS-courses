NewSQL refers to a class of modern relational database management systems (RDBMS) that combine the scalability and performance of NoSQL databases with the ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and SQL standards of traditional SQL databases.

## Key Features
NewSQL databases use distributed, shared-nothing architectures for horizontal scaling across multiple nodes, enabling them to handle massive data volumes and high-throughput workloads like OLTP (online transaction processing) without single points of failure. They support familiar SQL queries while providing fault tolerance through replication, automatic failover, and features like non-locking concurrency for low-latency reads.

Examples include Google Spanner, CockroachDB, and VoltDB, which excel in scenarios needing both strong consistency and global distribution. [graphapp](https://www.graphapp.ai/engineering-glossary/cloud-computing/newsql-databases)

## Comparison to SQL and NoSQL
| Aspect          | Traditional SQL       | NoSQL                  | NewSQL                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Scalability    | Vertical (limited)   | Horizontal (high)     | Horizontal (distributed)  |
| Consistency    | ACID                 | BASE (eventual)       | ACID                      |
| Query Language | SQL                  | Varied (no standard)  | SQL                       |
| Best For       | Small/medium apps    | Unstructured big data | Scalable transactions     |  [dbvis](https://www.dbvis.com/thetable/newsql-everything-you-need-to-know/)

In data engineering contexts like big data pipelines (e.g., with Kafka or Hadoop), NewSQL fills gaps by offering SQL familiarity for analytics alongside NoSQL-like elasticity. [aerospike](https://aerospike.com/glossary/newsql-rdms/)
